  "description": "Speak for the Trees Boston aims to improve the size and health of the urban forest in the greater Boston area, with a focus on under-served and under-canopied neighborhoods. They work with volunteers to inventory (collect data) trees, plant trees, and educate those about trees. C4C has built a tree stewardship application for SFTT that allows users to participate in conserving Boston's urban forest. Across Boston, hundreds of trees have been adopted and cared for.",
